### What is SegNetSim?
- A project aimed at creating a virtualized enterprise environment using EVE-NG. The project's intention is to detail the network segmentation configuration, security policies, implementation of IDS/IPS, among others, to create the most realistic and secure environment possible. The goal is to provide a ready-made structure in EVE-NG and documentation of the virtualized software on Medium/Dev.to.
